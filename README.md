# Rick and Morty meets Next.js

As i'm beginning to get more comfortable with using React, I wanted to start building more projects to strengthen my skills and just for the fun of it, which led me to building the Rick and Morty App.

## Project Goals

I knew that I wanted more practice connecting to an external API and displaying the retrieved data to the User. Also, I wanted to practice pagination and handling route changes that could receive query parameters and so on, because I figured this would be a common thing that I run into in real life situations.

### Why I chose Next.js

I was introduced to NextJs while taking the Wes Bos 'Advanced React and GraphQl' course and I really enjoyed using it. I really liked that it automatically handled all of the server side rendering, and I thought it was cool how they set up the folder structure to create pages by simply creating a file in the 'pages' folder. For this project I wasn't concerned about creating or mutating any data so I knew it should be a fairly simple setup, as I knew Next-Js had a lot of built in features that would allow me to start writing code ASAP.
