# Rick and Morty meets Next.js

As i'm beginning to get more comfortable with using React, I wanted to start building more projects to strengthen my skills and just for the fun of it, which led me to building the Rick and Morty App.

## Project Goals

I wanted to have a project where I could just experiment with different tools, and strengthen some skills that I thought would be useful in real world situations.

- Connect to an external API and display data to user.
- Implement pagination and handle route changes that could also receive query parameters.
- Have a loading component to signal page loads on route changes. For this I used NProgress.
- Make the app responsive to read well on all devices.

### Why I chose Next.js

- Automatic server side rendering.
- Folder structure, and ease of creating pages.
- Automatic code splitting.
- Built in hot code reloading.
- Not too steep of learning curve.

I was introduced to NextJs while taking the Wes Bos 'Advanced React and GraphQl' course and I really enjoyed using it. I really liked that it automatically handled all of the server side rendering, and I thought it was cool how they set up the folder structure to create pages by simply creating a file in the 'pages' folder. For this project I wasn't concerned about creating or mutating any data so I knew it should be a fairly simple setup, as I knew Next-Js had a lot of built in features that would allow me to start writing code ASAP.

### A few things I did
